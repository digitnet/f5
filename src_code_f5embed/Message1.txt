Matlab JPEG Toolbox
===================
This distribution contains routines for manipulating files formatted
according to the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) standard.
Matlab's built-in IMREAD and IMWRITE functions provide basic
conversion between JPEG files and image arrays. The routines in this
package provide additional functionality for directly accessing the
contents of JPEG files from Matlab, including the Discrete Cosine
Transform (DCT) coefficients, quantization tables, Huffman coding
tables, color space information, and comment markers.  It is assumed
that the user of this software has a good understanding of both the
JPEG compression standard and Matlab data structures.

This software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG
Group (IJG), as it makes use of IJG's free JPEG code library.  If the
MEX file binaries provided in this distribution are not the ones you
need for your system, you will need to download IJG's code library and
install it on your system before compiling the source code.  See
"Installing" for more details.

If you find this software useful, or if you would like to contribute
to the project, please send me email.

Installing
==========
Copy all of the files into a new directory.  Add this directory to the
Matlab startup path, if desired.  Compile the MEX routines, if
necessary.

Compiled MEX routines with the extension .dll, are provided for
Windows 9x/NT/2000 systems.  These were compiled for Matlab
6.5.0.180913a (R13) using the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler.  If you
have a different version of Matlab, they may not work on your system.
For use on other platforms, you will need to take the following steps
to compile the MEX routines.

In order to compile the MEX routines, you must first build IJG's JPEG Tools
code library, available at ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz.
Download and build the libjpeg library using the make files and instructions
contained in the IJG JPEG distribution.  

Once the IJG libjpeg library has been built, execute the following commands
from the command shell or from inside a Matlab window, depending on your
Matlab configuration:

mex -I<IJGPATH> jpeg_read.c <LIBJPEG>
mex -I<IJGPATH> jpeg_write.c <LIBJPEG>

Replace <IJGPATH> with the path to the IJG jpeg-6b directory, and
<LIBJPEG> with the full path to the IJG code library file, generally
saved as libjpeg.a or libjpeg.lib depending on the operating system.

The following Matlab functions are included in this distribution:

jpeg_read     	Read a JPEG file into a JPEG object struct
jpeg_write    	Write a JPEG object struct to a JPEG file
jpeg_qtable   	Generate standard JPEG quantization tables
bdct          	Blocked discrete cosine transform
ibdct         	Inverse blocked discrete cosine transform
